# FB8078676 [Catalyst] When switching to Optimize Interface for Mac, accessoryView no longer works on Table View Cells.

Observe attached example. It uses a simple UITableViewController with a cell that sets a UISwitch as accessoryView. This works as expected when using the scaled Catalyst mode, but does not display the checkbox when using the optimized for Mac interface mode.

Tested with macOS Big Sur b2
