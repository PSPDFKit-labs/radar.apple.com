# FB7414880: UINavigationBarAppearance is not applied after navigation bar is already visible

Customizing `UINavigationBar` appearance via the new `UINavigationBarAppearance` has no effect after such `UINavigationBar` is already added to the view hierarchy.

In other words, the below code has no effect for a `navigationBar` that is already in the view hierarchy:

```
let appearance = UINavigationBarAppearance()
appearance.backgroundColor = .systemRed

navigationBar.standardAppearance = appearance
navigationBar.compactAppearance = appearance
navigationBar.scrollEdgeAppearance = appearance
```

STEPS TO REPRODUCE

1. Open the attached Demo project and run it.
2. Tap â€œChange color" button.

EXPECTED RESULT

The navigation bar changes its background color.

ACTUAL RESULT

No effect.

KNOWN WORKAROUND

Asking navigation bar to lay out via `setNeedsLayout()` makes it work. Uncomment the last line in `ViewController.changeColor()` in the Demo project to see this in action.
