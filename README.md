# Sample Projects for Apple Feedback

This repository contains most of the feedback reports we send to Apple. We can’t share all samples because some might contain sensitive data or [PSPDFKit](https://pspdfkit.com/) source code, but we try to share as much as we can.

Why so much feedback? We have many customers and they often run into weird edge cases and we help them to solve their issue. Sometimes it’s our bug, sometimes Apple is to blame - but our customers pay good money for our product so they want a solution, not an excuse. So most feedback also includes a workaround - sometimes horrible, sometimes decent, sometimes desperate. Pull requests appreciated if you find better solutions.
